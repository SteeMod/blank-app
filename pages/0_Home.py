st.write("The latest technology [AI] is making working with the oldest technology[pen and paper] a whole lot easier, the Medication Tracker utilizes Azure AI Document Intelligence to extract medication tracker data from PDF files and save it as digital data. I have developed  a simple form to track medication intake by using pen and paper. This is  a hassle free and more natural way of tracking progress on intake rather than â€˜tinkeringâ€™ with digital devices which often need WIFI, power, internet, subscription to operate. When its all done you will need a device to upload the PDF ðŸ˜Š.Please follow instructions to test how well the solution extracts data from raw to digital.  There is a Review page to check accuracy of the output, particularly hand written recording. Remember to use FICTITIOUS information as this solution is STRICTLY for testing purposes. Alternatively, you can download a pre-filled form and use it for testing. Please remember to leave a comment on the comment page or via email.")
